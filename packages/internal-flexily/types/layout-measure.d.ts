/**
 * Node Measurement (Intrinsic Sizing)
 *
 * measureNode() computes a node's width and height without calculating positions.
 * It's a lightweight alternative to layoutNode() used during Phase 5 for
 * intrinsic sizing of auto-sized container children.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: measureNode() overwrites layout.width/layout.height as a side effect.
 * Callers MUST save/restore these fields around calls to avoid corrupting
 * the fingerprint cache (see "Bug 1: measureNode corruption" in CLAUDE.md).
